#  About Me:
Master’s student in **Data Science** with a strong **applied mathematics** focus, specializing in **probabilistic modeling, statistical learning, stochastic processes, and optimization**.

I work at the intersection of **mathematics, data, and real-world systems**, with particular interest in **climate, energy, and risk-aware decision making**. My approach emphasizes **explicit assumptions, uncertainty quantification, and robustness**, rather than black-box prediction.

> *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.”*  
> — **Albert Einstein**

##  Core Strengths:
- Mathematical problem formulation under uncertainty  
- Statistical & probabilistic modeling (Monte Carlo, Bayesian methods, stochastic processes)  
- Time-series analysis for climate, energy, and dynamic systems  
- Feature engineering informed by physical and domain knowledge  
- Optimization and decision support under constraints  
- Clear communication of assumptions, limitations, and risk

##  Climate & Energy Focus:
- Probabilistic forecasting of climate- and weather-driven systems  
- Modeling uncertainty in energy demand, prices, and emissions  
- Simulation-based analysis of environmental and dynamic systems  
- Sensitivity analysis to assess robustness under climate variability  
- Decision-oriented modeling for sustainability and policy contexts

### ✍️ Modeling Philosophy
*“Nature is pleased with simplicity.”* — **Isaac Newton**

I aim to build models that are **mathematically grounded, uncertainty-aware, and decision-relevant**
